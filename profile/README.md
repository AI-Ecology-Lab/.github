# Britten & Carter AI Ecology Lab

Welcome to the Britten & Carter AI Ecology Lab! Our research focuses on advancing ecological studies through cutting-edge artificial intelligence techniques. We specialize in developing machine learning models to analyze complex ecosystems, aiming to improve conservation efforts and environmental monitoring across marine and terrestrial environments.

## Research Interests

Our lab is dedicated to exploring ecological dynamics using AI, with distinct expertise in both marine and terrestrial systems:

- **Marine Ecology (Atticus Carter)**: We leverage computer vision and machine learning to study benthic ecosystem. Our research involves tracking faunal morphotypes, quantifying biomass, and analyzing ecological variations across different geographic locations. Current projects include detecting and monitoring ocean plastics, studying benthic megafauna at hydrothermal vents, and modeling sediment movement using time-series data.

- **Terrestrial Ecology (Anton Britten)**: Our terrestrial research employs AI to monitor wildlife populations, analyze habitat usage, and assess the impact of climate change on biodiversity. We use object detection and spatial analysis to track species movement and population dynamics, aiming to support conservation initiatives and ecosystem management. Key areas of interest include remote sensing for wildlife detection and AI-driven behavioral studies.

## Lab Mission

At the Britten & Carter AI Ecology Lab, our mission is to harness AI's potential to enhance ecological research and promote sustainable interactions between human activities and natural environments. We strive to develop innovative solutions that contribute to both scientific knowledge and practical conservation efforts.
