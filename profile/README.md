# AI Ecology Lab

Welcome to the AI Ecology Lab! Our research focuses on applying AI to ecology use cases. We specialize in developing machine learning models to analyze complex ecosystems, aiming to improve conservation efforts and environmental monitoring across marine and terrestrial environments.

## Research Interests

Our lab is dedicated to exploring ecological dynamics using AI, with distinct expertise in both marine and terrestrial systems:

- **Marine Ecology (Katie Bigham & Ada Carter)**

- **Terrestrial Ecology (Anton Britten)**
